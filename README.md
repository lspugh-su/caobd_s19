### Computational Analysis of Big Data

This is the GitHub page for the course [Computational Analysis for Big Data](https://disabroad.org/copenhagen/courses/computation-analyses-big-data/) offered by [DIS](https://disabroad.org/).

To get started:

1. Fire up a terminal/console on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory in your computer where you keep the folder for this course
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/ulfaslak/computational_analysis_of_big_data_2018_fall`

Now you have all the course files on your computer. When I update the course material (and I do every now and then) you can get the newest version of all the files by running `git pull origin master` from inside the course folder. I recommend you get used to doing this before every class session, so that you don't solve outdated exercises.

**Important**: Do not edit the files that you pull from this Github repository. Because I update them every now and then, changes you make will potentially be overwritten and lost. Instead, copy the exercise and assignment notebooks out of the git directory and into another directory where you can start filling them out with solutions.
