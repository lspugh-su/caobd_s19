    "Today's exercises will be related to chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 from DSfS. The point of these exercises is to refresh your memory on some mathematics and get you comfortable doing computations in code.\n",

    "The exercises today cover:\n",
    "* Basic visualization\n",
    "* Linear algebra\n",
    "* Statistics\n",
    "* Probability theory\n",

    "**Advice**: Some of you may be new to solving problems using code. You may be wondering *what level of detail* I expect in your solutions, your code comments and explanations. **This is the guideline:** Solve the exercises in a manner that allows you to—later in life—use them as examples. This also means that you should add code comments when the code isn't self-explanatory or if you're afraid it won't make sense when you look at it with fresh eyes. You may also want to comment on your output in plain text to capture the conclusions you arrive at throughout your analysis. But express yourself succinctly. To quote our friend Einstein: *\"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler\"*. When you optimize for your own future comprehension, other people will also be able to understand what you did.\n",
